# Luxe Wear – Final Responsive Project

**Luxe Wear** is a bold, fashion-forward clothing brand website built to meet modern web design standards across all devices. This is a fully responsive site with a unique, vibrant brand identity and clear divergence from the original mockup, especially in branding, color, layout structure, and responsiveness.

## 🎨 Color System

| Color Name       | Hex        | Purpose                                          |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Burnt Peach      | `#ffe6d8`  | Hero & journal sections — warm, soft welcome    |
| pink             | `#ffc0cb`  | Section wrapper background — feminine & premium |
| Gold Accent      | `#f4d03f`  | Highlighted headings and call-to-action emphasis |
| Deep Charcoal    | `#111111`  | CTA buttons and strong text contrast            |
| White            | `#ffffff`  | Product card background and input fields        |

**Color Rationale:**
- **Burnt Peach** sets a warm, welcoming tone for first-time visitors.
- **Orchid Mauve** adds a modern, elegant fashion feel throughout wrapped sections.
- **Gold Accent** draws attention to call-to-actions and headings with a luxe finish.
- **Deep Charcoal** ensures clarity and accessibility on light backgrounds.

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **LG (≥ 1024px)**: Preserves the original mockup's layout with horizontal scrollable product cards.
- **MD (768px–1023px)**: Adjusted to stacked flex-column layouts and two-column sections.
- **SM (< 768px)**: Fully stacked sections, single-column flow, mobile-friendly buttons and spacing.

## Creative Divergence from the Mockup

- Introduced a **luxury-inspired color palette** (peach, orchid, gold).
- Added **rounded card-style wrappers** for all major sections (About, Lookbook, Journal, etc.).
- Rebranded content to **“LUXE Wear”**, representing bold, confident youth fashion.
- Applied **smooth scrolling, sticky navigation, and active link highlights** for improved UX.
- Integrated a **scrollable product gallery** using `scroll-snap` for mobile responsiveness.
